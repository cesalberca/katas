# Caesar Cypher

The action of a Caesar cipher is to replace each plaintext letter with a different one a fixed number of places up or down the alphabet.

This program performs a variation of the Caesar shift. The shift increases by 1 for each character (on each iteration).

If the shift is initially 1, the first character of the message to be encoded will be shifted by 1, the second character will be shifted by 2, etc...

u = "I should have known that you would have a perfect answer for me!!!"

movingShift(u, 1) returns :

v = ["J vltasl rlhr ", "zdfog odxr ypw", " atasl rlhr p ", "gwkzzyq zntyhv", " lvz wp!!!"]
